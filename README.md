# wordpress-static-page
Creating this website are one of task during my internship. 
I create website with Wordpress and The theme I used is Onepress-Owner.
Even so, i make some changes such as family-font, font-size, padding, margin, color background, and footer (maps, media social icon).
This code exported by using WP2static plugin. WP2static make the website from dynamic to static page. 
This code is homepage only.
