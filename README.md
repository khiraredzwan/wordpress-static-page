# wordpress-static-page
Originality, creating this website are one of task during my internship. 
I create website with Wordpress and The theme I used is Onepress-Owner.
Even so, the homepage I created differ from the actual theme. 
This code exported by using WP2static plugin. WP2static make the website from dynamic to static page. 
This code is homepage only.
